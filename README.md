This repository demonstrates a common Tcl error: incorrect syntax in an `if` statement. The `bug.tcl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from neglecting to properly enclose the `then` and `else` branches of the `if` statement with curly braces. This is a crucial aspect of Tcl's syntax and failing to adhere to it will cause a syntax error.
